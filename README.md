# Train-Schedule

All in all this assignment felt much easier than any of the previous assignments.  I did have the following issues:

  -My first attempt at mapping out the structure inlcuded for loops.  I started by working through the moment.js math and formatting, then I went on to dynamically generate the html.  When it came time to begin working on the database functions, I realized I had built the roof before the walls and the foundation.  I found it easiest to start over and rebuilt the entire app.
  
   -I was not able to figure out how to filter the updates to the database to prevent redundant entries.  Still working on that one!
   
   -I have not yet started on the bonus objectives.
